My immediate goal is to work at Professional Business Associates. Through your company, i will learn the information and skills needed to manage my own business.  I will go above and beyond to learn all that I can, to do all that I must to achieve the experience needed. 

Through working as a Den Guide at Camp Cowles, I have learned the hard working leadership skills and management through keeping the Scouts together and organized. By achieving the rank of an Eagle Scout, the highest rank in the Boy Scouts, I have learned necessary skills to put together proposals, keep them organized, and being a leader for others. While being Varsity Team Captain in the boy scouts,  I have gained experience managing a group and keeping them on track to get to camp's, go on camp outs, and even do other various activity's.

I have recently noticed an opening in your company for the Human Resources Assistant, and am highly interested in the position. Working with the public is what made the position stand out to me and from what I understand that is a key role for a Human Resources Assistant. I currently hold a 3.8 grade point average and many of my classes that I have taken have specialized in working with people.
 
If I was to be apart of the large corporation known as Professional Business Associates, I feel I can be a positive addition to the company's success because of my experiences in leadership roles. Throughout high school I have taken on many leadership positions from sports to academics and have attended a couple leadership seminars such as HOBY and All Girls State.

My resume is attached. I truly appreciate your reading of this letter. I hope by this letter you have learned a little bit about me and if you have any questions regarding additional information please feel free to contact me by email at gibs4ever@yahoo.com or by phone at (208)-215-0708. I look forward to any further discussion regarding this position.

I had manage to possess a 3.5 grade point average within both Timberlake High School and Eastern Washington University. I am more than willing to learn new skills about how to handle young children and teenagers that will help me in doing my job correctly.
I have a feeling that I may have a great impact within the school district. I have been able to understand what children are like through my years of babysitting. I have also volunteered at Eastern Washington University to tutor children who live in the area that struggle in school. Having to work with these children has helped me for the better. I was able to gain the knowledge of teaching children, and gave me the opportunities to learn how children think and behave.

I am writing to you in response to the job opening that was mentioned on your website . As of now I am currently seeking a summer job and through all my searching I found that Skyzone was the better option to apply for. I believe that I can bring my skills and talent to the table to help benefit you and the company. 





I am currently  attending Johns Creek High School  as a sophomore and will next year be a junior. The past two summers I have participated/volunteered at Camp All American on the Yes Crew. Camp All American is a summer camp for the age groups preschool all the way to eighth grade, the campers do different activities, sports, and ropes course  with their counselors. Being a camper since preschool, I was elated to hear that they were having a something for highschool students called Yes Crew, which gave me the opportunity to be apart of the camp again.  As Yes Crew member  manning the camp store, setting up and breaking down each day for camp, supporting the customer service staff, and helping out with the ropes course. Our team was vitally important in keeping Camp All-American running smoothly. Throughout the last two summers I have learned how to , work with a team, handle responsibilities, and  also built up my leadership skills. Being placed into a teamwork environment, I took roles as being the leader of the team and keeping everything and everyone under control. Sometimes we had to watch over a counselors group or take the hurt campers to the clinic. It was our responsibility to make sure the the campers were safe while doing ropes course and playing sports. I know that through that experience I have learned to become responsible and reliable with not only other peoples kids but with important responsibilities and I believe that I can do the same at Sky Zone.  





At Sky Zone I can be wherever you want me to be whenever you need me to be there. Yes Crew lead me on the track of being on time, mainly ahead of time, in the morning and also to many different events I have attended. I believe that this is the type of person you need working at a place such as Sky Zone, someone efficient, on time, and reliable. To my understanding,  an employee at Sky Zone must be comfortable around kids and able to adapt to changes. Me being surround by little kids my whole life and having to take care of them, which I love, I feel as though I am prepared for the job. I love being around kids and taking care of them I truly improved my care skills through Yes Crew also due to being around so many campers.




I would love to get the opportunity to get an  interview with you or someone other than you for the job. It would be a great experience for me to work for Sky Zone this summer, in the way of becoming even more responsible and being able to learn the value of saving and earning money. I believe Sky Zone would be the perfect place for me to not only offer my skills but also to learn some new ones.




 Thank you for your time, Sincerely
