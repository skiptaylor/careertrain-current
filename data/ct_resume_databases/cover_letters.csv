I have an interest in teaching children, and I am also great with children. From my understanding, the Helena School District offers opportunities for new teachers to gain experience in the field of teaching. I had manage to possess a 3.5 grade point average within both Timberlake High School and Eastern Washington University. I am more than willing to learn new skills about how to handle young children and teenagers that will help me in doing my job correctly.
I have a feeling that I may have a great impact within the school district. I have been able to understand what children are like through my years of babysitting. I have also volunteered at Eastern Washington University to tutor children who live in the area that struggle in school. Having to work with these children has helped me for the better. I was able to gain the knowledge of teaching children, and gave me the opportunities to learn how children think and behave.
My resume and transcript are attached. I will appreciate your consideration of my credentials. If I can provide any additional information, I would very much appreciate it if you let me know. You can reach me by email at krhanimegirl@gmail.com or by phone at (208) 818-5099. I am looking forward to discussing my qualifications with you in person. 
Sincerely,
