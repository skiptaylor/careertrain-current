				<blockquote><i class="icon-quote-left"></i> Here is an example of how effective the Career Direction 2 program truly works: Ms. S had an idea of what her career interests were but the program further confirmed her interests in the military and clerical. Upon receiving her results, she enlisted in the Illinois Army National Guard a week later as a supply clerk.<br />

				<blockquote><i class="icon-quote-left"></i> My high school has a policy of only lunchroom displays and absolutely NO classroom time. But, one of the teachers invited me to present Career Direction 2. By the end of class 3 of 6, the kids were talking in the other classrooms; teachers were stopping outside the door to listen. Tomorrow, I finish....and meet with other teachers.<br />
