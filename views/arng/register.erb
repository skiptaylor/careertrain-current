					Before presenting the <strong>Career Direction 2</strong> workshop, register your school 
					(organization) to generate a password so students can access the Internet <strong>Career 
					Direction 2</strong> Career Planning Tools.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The <i>Careers and Occupations Guide Report</i> provides students with a customized 
					career planning report based on the <strong>Career Direction 2</strong> exercise. Because the CD2 exercise is easily self-scored, students can create these reports immediately if the optional exercise is conducted. If the exercise questionnaire is not used, students can simply select two of the career categories they find intriguing based on the description in the CD2 workbook and cteate an immediate report.
					However, in order for Counselor and Recruiter reports to be generated by CTC, scanforms must 
					be returned to CTC.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					You should give the password to your students during your <strong>Career Direction 2</strong> 
					presentation.
				</p>
				
				<p>After the class, be sure to return CD2 exercise scanforms to CTC:</p>
